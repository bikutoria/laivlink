# Development log

- **Initial Setup**:
  - Created a Node.js backend using Express and Cohere AI API for question generation.
  - Set up a simple HTML front-end to accept user input (goal and theme) and display responses.
  - Added minimal CSS for basic styling.

- **Functionality Enhancements**:
  - Implemented multiple-choice selections for goals and themes.
  - Added buttons for user feedback (üëç, ‚ù§Ô∏è, üëé, ‚ôªÔ∏è) and response retrieval.
  - Enabled goal and theme selection to dynamically update available themes based on selected goals.

- **User Experience Improvements**:
  - Introduced a loading indicator (GIF) to show during response fetching.
  - Split the interface into "Choice Submission" and "Questions & Feedback" sections for better user flow.
  - Added functionality to return to the choice submission screen and start a new session.

- **Analytics Integration**:
  - Integrated Amplitude for tracking events such as session starts, choice submissions, and feedback interactions.
  - Ensured console logs for Amplitude events for debugging purposes.

- **Development Mode**:
  - Introduced a dev mode toggle via a browser console command (`enableDevMode()`).
  - Hid console logs and certain buttons unless dev mode is enabled.
